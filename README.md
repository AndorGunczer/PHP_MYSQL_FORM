# PHP_MYSQL_Form
A simple form which uses php and mysql for backend and database.

Project:
  I. Setting up a MySQL database: Read MySQL documentation, download, setup.
  II. Create semantic HTML form that serves as the skeleton of the website, then add minimalistic styling with vanilla CSS.
  III. Write logic with PHP so that the data inputted by the user through the form can be stored on the mySQL database.
  IV. Data of the user can be accessed in case of need.

This Project served as a refreshment of basic level usage of mysql and php, it was really a beautiful experience to relive the feelings of that era
while working on this project, also I realized I actually love php.
